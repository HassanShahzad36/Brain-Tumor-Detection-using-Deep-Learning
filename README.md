## Introduction

Medical imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing various health conditions, including brain tumors. However, manual interpretation of these images can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Deep Learning techniques offer a promising solution by automating the detection process.

This project provides a deep learning model trained on a dataset containing brain images with and without tumors. The model is capable of classifying whether a given brain image contains a tumor or not.

## Installation

numpy,pandas,tensorflow,keras, matplotlib

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction. Dropout layers are utilized to prevent overfitting. The final output layer utilizes a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

## Data Preprocessing

- Images are resized to 224x224 pixels.
- Data augmentation techniques like zooming, shearing, and horizontal flipping are applied during training.

## Training

The model is trained using the adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. Early stopping and model checkpointing techniques are employed to monitor validation accuracy and save the best-performing model.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated on a separate testing dataset using accuracy as the metric. Additionally, loss and accuracy graphs are plotted to visualize model training and validation performance.

## Sample Prediction

A sample prediction is demonstrated using a test image. The model predicts whether the brain image contains a tumor or not.
